1	Hello Mingyang! Are you doing well?	Hi advisor. I'm doing alright. I would like some advice on which courses to take next semester. My interested area is Software Development and Intelligent system.	you have three choices namely, EECS481 Software Engineering, EECS492 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, and EECS381 Object Oriented and Advanced Programming.	how many difficulty levels do these classes have?	EECS381 is not easy any thoughts about that?	What time does the course occur? I like afternoon classes and will find something else if it's scheduled too early.	EECS351 is after lunch. The others are before. EECS481 is from nine to ten thirty and EECS492 is from ten thirty to twelve.	You might not want to take 481. It starts early in the morning and is quite similar to EECS381.

My interested area is Software Development and Intelligent system.	you have three choices namely, EECS481 Software Engineering, EECS492 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, and EECS381 Object Oriented and Advanced Programming.	how many difficulty levels do these classes have?	EECS381 is not easy any thoughts about that?	What time does the course occur? I like afternoon classes and will find something else if it's scheduled too early.	EECS351 is after lunch. The others are before. EECS481 is from nine to ten thirty and EECS492 is from ten thirty to twelve. 481 is the early morning and is quite similar to EECS381, so you might want to skip it. How about EECS494 Computer Game Design and Development? It's after lunch and is what you're interested in. It's also hard enough for you.	Can another interesting course be recommended by you that is in the afternoon and has a high clarity. It shounds like a good match. What is the clarity level?

0	Hello Mingyang! Are you doing well?	Hi advisor. I'm doing alright. I would like some advice on which courses to take next semester. My interested area is Software Development and Intelligent system.	you have three choices namely, EECS481 Software Engineering, EECS492 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, and EECS381 Object Oriented and Advanced Programming.	how many difficulty levels do these classes have?	EECS381 is not easy any thoughts about that?	What time does the course occur? I like afternoon classes and will find something else if it's scheduled too early.	EECS351 is after lunch. The others are before. EECS481 is from nine to ten thirty and EECS492 is from ten thirty to twelve. 481 is the early morning and is quite similar to EECS381, so you might want to skip it. How about EECS494 Computer Game Design and Development? It's after lunch and is what you're interested in. It's also hard enough for you.	Can another interesting course be recommended by you that is in the afternoon and has a high clarity. It shounds like a good match. What is the clarity level? Will the professors be able to make their lectures easy to be understood?	A high clarity rating is EECS494 as well.	Great, that's so awesome. That's all I have to ask. Many thanks for your suggestions.	Hi! What can I assist you with today?

Many thanks for your suggestions.	I would suggest that you take EECS 281 as quickly as possible; it will give you the opportunity to enroll in many more classes in coming semesters so that you can graduate in four years.
0	Hello Mingyang! Are you doing well?	Hi advisor. I'm doing alright. I would like some advice on which courses to take next semester. My interested area is Software Development and Intelligent system.	you have three choices namely, EECS481 Software Engineering, EECS492 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, and EECS381 Object Oriented and Advanced Programming.	how many difficulty levels do these classes have?	EECS381 is not easy any thoughts about that?	What time does the course occur? I like afternoon classes and will find something else if it's scheduled too early.	EECS351 is after lunch. The others are before. EECS481 is from nine to ten thirty and EECS492 is from ten thirty to twelve. 481 is the early morning and is quite similar to EECS381, so you might want to skip it. How about EECS494 Computer Game Design and Development? It's after lunch and is what you're interested in. It's also hard enough for you.	Can another interesting course be recommended by you that is in the afternoon and has a high clarity. It shounds like a good match. What is the clarity level? Will the professors be able to make their lectures easy to be understood?	A high clarity rating is EECS494 as well.	Great, that's so awesome. That's all I have to ask. Many thanks for your suggestions.	No worries, have a great day!

0	Hello Mingyang! Are you doing well?	Hi advisor. I'm doing alright. I would like some advice on which courses to take next semester. My interested area is Software Development and Intelligent system.	you have three choices namely, EECS481 Software Engineering, EECS492 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, and EECS381 Object Oriented and Advanced Programming.	how many difficulty levels do these classes have?	EECS381 is not easy any thoughts about that?	What time does the course occur? I like afternoon classes and will find something else if it's scheduled too early.	EECS351 is after lunch. The others are before. EECS481 is from nine to ten thirty and EECS492 is from ten thirty to twelve. 481 is the early morning and is quite similar to EECS381, so you might want to skip it. How about EECS494 Computer Game Design and Development? It's after lunch and is what you're interested in. It's also hard enough for you.	Can another interesting course be recommended by you that is in the afternoon and has a high clarity. It shounds like a good match. What is the clarity level? Will the professors be able to make their lectures easy to be understood?	A high clarity rating is EECS494 as well.	Great, that's so awesome. That's all I have to ask. Many thanks for your suggestions.	It appears upper level CS courses are still something you need.
