1	Hello!	Hi!	im trying to decide what classes to take next semester. Any suggestions?	Give me a minute to look at your transcript. Can your preferences be told to me by you.	Of course! I am curious about Computer Science, video game design is something that has always been interesting for me.	For most computer science classes, Eecs 280 should be mandatory including game design.	Okay, I will accept that course. What advise you have on any other prerequisites for game design?	Eecs 281 is also necessary, and unfortunately you can't take both 280 and 281 in the same semester. You should take Eecs 203 since it's a prerequisite for most Eecs classes	Okay, thanks for information.  Are both EECS 203 and 280 based on projects?	280 is all project based and 203 is not, but don't get confused many students believe 203 is harder than 280.

Okay, I will accept that course. What advise you have on any other prerequisites for game design?	Eecs 281 is also necessary, and unfortunately you can't take both 280 and 281 in the same semester.	The class size is larger, as it is a required class.

0	Hello!	Hi!	im trying to decide what classes to take next semester. Any suggestions?	Give me a minute to look at your transcript. Can your preferences be told to me by you.	Of course! I am curious about Computer Science, video game design is something that has always been interesting for me.	For most computer science classes, Eecs 280 should be mandatory including game design.	Okay, I will accept that course. What advise you have on any other prerequisites for game design?	Eecs 281 is also necessary, and unfortunately you can't take both 280 and 281 in the same semester. You should take Eecs 203 since it's a prerequisite for most Eecs classes	Okay, thanks for information.  Are both EECS 203 and 280 based on projects?	280 is all project based and 203 is not, but don't let that fool you. Many students say 203 is harder than 280	Oh, wow.  Okay, so do you imagine that taking both of them in the same semester will be manageable?	EECS 376 is my suggestion for easier workload

I am curious about Computer Science, video game design is something that has always been interesting for me.	For most computer science classes, Eecs 280 should be mandatory including game design.	Okay, I will accept that course. What advise you have on any other prerequisites for game design?	Eecs 281 is also necessary, and unfortunately you can't take both 280 and 281 in the same semester. You should take Eecs 203 since it's a prerequisite for most Eecs classes	Okay, thanks for information.  Are both EECS 203 and 280 based on projects?	280 is all project based and 203 is not, but don't let that fool you. Many students say 203 is harder than 280	Oh, wow.  Okay, so do you imagine that taking both of them in the same semester will be manageable?	Believe it or not, you've already taken three chemistry classes.

1	Hello!	Hi!	im trying to decide what classes to take next semester. Any suggestions?	Give me a minute to look at your transcript. Can your preferences be told to me by you.	Of course! I am curious about Computer Science, video game design is something that has always been interesting for me.	For most computer science classes, Eecs 280 should be mandatory including game design.	Okay, I will accept that course. What advise you have on any other prerequisites for game design?	Eecs 281 is also necessary, and unfortunately you can't take both 280 and 281 in the same semester. You should take Eecs 203 since it's a prerequisite for most Eecs classes	Okay, thanks for information.  Are both EECS 203 and 280 based on projects?	280 is all project based and 203 is not, but don't get confused many students believe 203 is harder than 280.

Some good Capstone classes are EECS 441, EECS 467, EECS 481, and EECS 494.
0	Hello!	Hi!	im trying to decide what classes to take next semester. Any suggestions?	Give me a minute to look at your transcript. Can your preferences be told to me by you.	Of course! I am curious about Computer Science, video game design is something that has always been interesting for me.	For most computer science classes, Eecs 280 should be mandatory including game design.	Okay, I will accept that course. What advise you have on any other prerequisites for game design?	Eecs 281 is also necessary, and unfortunately you can't take both 280 and 281 in the same semester.	Pleased I could take care of it for you.

Yes, there are CS majors who have a second major within the EECS department. However, it's only the EE major because Data Science is too similar to CS to be an option for a second major.

From the course description, it is: "Professional problem-solving methods developed through intensive group studies. Normally one significant design project is chosen for entire class requiring multiple EECS disciplines and teams. Use of analytic, computer, design, and experimental techniques where applicable are used."
