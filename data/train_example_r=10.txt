1	Hello!	Hi!	im trying to decide what classes to take next semester. Any suggestions?	Give me a minute to look at your transcript. Can your preferences be told to me by you.	Of course! I am curious about Computer Science, video game design is something that has always been interesting for me.	For most computer science classes, Eecs 280 should be mandatory including game design.	Okay, I will accept that course. What advise you have on any other prerequisites for game design?	Eecs 281 is also necessary, and unfortunately you can't take both 280 and 281 in the same semester. You should take Eecs 203 since it's a prerequisite for most Eecs classes	Okay, thanks for information.  Are both EECS 203 and 280 based on projects?	280 is all project based and 203 is not, but don't get confused many students believe 203 is harder than 280.

I am curious about Computer Science, video game design is something that has always been interesting for me.	For most computer science classes, Eecs 280 should be mandatory including game design.	Okay, I will accept that course. What advise you have on any other prerequisites for game design?	Eecs 281 is also necessary, and unfortunately you can't take both 280 and 281 in the same semester. You should take Eecs 203 since it's a prerequisite for most Eecs classes	Okay, thanks for information.  Are both EECS 203 and 280 based on projects?	280 is all project based and 203 is not, but don't let that fool you. Many students say 203 is harder than 280	Oh, wow.  Okay, so do you imagine that taking both of them in the same semester will be manageable?	Is this what you are looking for your major/minor?

Okay, I will accept that course. What advise you have on any other prerequisites for game design?	Eecs 281 is also necessary, and unfortunately you can't take both 280 and 281 in the same semester. You should take Eecs 203 since it's a prerequisite for most Eecs classes	Okay, thanks for information.  Are both EECS 203 and 280 based on projects?	280 is all project based and 203 is not, but don't let that fool you. Many students say 203 is harder than 280	Oh, wow.  Okay, so do you imagine that taking both of them in the same semester will be manageable?	"Elementary Programming Concepts" is a fairly easy course.

Okay, I will accept that course. What advise you have on any other prerequisites for game design?	Eecs 281 is also necessary, and unfortunately you can't take both 280 and 281 in the same semester. You should take Eecs 203 since it's a prerequisite for most Eecs classes	Okay, thanks for information.  Are both EECS 203 and 280 based on projects?	What can I do for you?

I am curious about Computer Science, video game design is something that has always been interesting for me.	For most computer science classes, Eecs 280 should be mandatory including game design.	Okay, I will accept that course. What advise you have on any other prerequisites for game design?	Eecs 281 is also necessary, and unfortunately you can't take both 280 and 281 in the same semester. You should take Eecs 203 since it's a prerequisite for most Eecs classes	Okay, thanks for information.  Are both EECS 203 and 280 based on projects?	280 is all project based and 203 is not, but don't let that fool you. Many students say 203 is harder than 280	Oh, wow.  Okay, so do you imagine that taking both of them in the same semester will be manageable?	376 is the easier course, but 281 is a must.

I am curious about Computer Science, video game design is something that has always been interesting for me.	For most computer science classes, Eecs 280 should be mandatory including game design.	Okay, I will accept that course. What advise you have on any other prerequisites for game design?	Eecs 281 is also necessary, and unfortunately you can't take both 280 and 281 in the same semester. You should take Eecs 203 since it's a prerequisite for most Eecs classes	Okay, thanks for information.  Are both EECS 203 and 280 based on projects?	From my experience if you will take EECS 281, you might as well get the 4 credits from taking EECS 370.

I am curious about Computer Science, video game design is something that has always been interesting for me.	For most computer science classes, Eecs 280 should be mandatory including game design.	Okay, I will accept that course. What advise you have on any other prerequisites for game design?	Eecs 281 is also necessary, and unfortunately you can't take both 280 and 281 in the same semester. You should take Eecs 203 since it's a prerequisite for most Eecs classes	Okay, thanks for information.  Are both EECS 203 and 280 based on projects?	280 is all project based and 203 is not, but don't let that fool you. Many students say 203 is harder than 280	Oh, wow.  Okay, so do you imagine that taking both of them in the same semester will be manageable?	It's perfectly manageable if your decent and probability and combinations.
